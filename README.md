New to React Native? Follow this guide to learn and implement a functional React Native app! This is a starter app to get an idea of what to install to start a project and basic syntax. The code is based on the outdated tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frvXANSaSec).

## Installation
Go to Facebook's installation [tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and follow the steps with these configurations: 
- React Native CLI Quickstart 
- Development OS: macOS
- Target OS: Android

You should download Android Studio and Homebrew from their website before starting. 

The following steps should help in debugging. 
1. Go to the home directory. 
2. Type `react-native -v` to verify the version. 
   - If you get `command not found` then the following steps that edit your `.bash_profile` may help.
